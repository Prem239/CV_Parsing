I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, as well as putting free time towards business ideas e.g. the clothing line that I started 3years ago, and now delegate to of friends. We have put on and managed showcases to help expand the clothing lines reputable image and build awareness; and lastly I play a big hand in managing online presence from the blog, Facebook, twitter to the website which is the main selling platform. To date we have managed to present a successful pitch to get three stores that now house our brand. , I am a keen positive-thinker. Im always eager to expand my skill set. My other hobbies included creative cooking, health and fitness and last but not least reading. , PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENTS, I have project-managed Crown Academy School of Hair Extensions rebranding and marketing. Organisation and timing was a must and a large amount of planning was involved. This increased my time-management and people skills. In addition, I have worked alongside an interior designer. I presented myself as a salesman to shops, mainly boutiques, and explained how slight adjustments within the shop window and floor can make a big difference to revenue. From this I learned how to offer a service to solve a solution that people are willing to pay for. I am also currently in the process of creating a media-based website. This is not an ideal way to make large profits, but a great way to network., I have had a fair amount of business experience through small family entrepreneurial ideas, which have in turn allowed me to make a considerably good amount of profit from importing goods, online retail, elements of motor trading etc. I had to quickly learn how each market worked, as well as having close control costing so that I can have a healthy profit margin. Communication skills were key, and due this past experience, I have no problems when it comes to adapting it to my day-to-day activities. , References available on request')\n",
